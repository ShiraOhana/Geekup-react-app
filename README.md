# :game_die: Geekup React App 
This is my mid-project (front-end) of Fullstack Development Bootcamp - Appleseeds.

## Description
When I was working on my thesis and had to interview geeks, I wanted to understand where they hang out. <br />
After searching different websites and facebook groups I realized I couldn't find a single site or group that collects all the information about recent events or meetups. <br /> <br />
I decided to build such a site myself and to add a board for people to find and meet each other based on fandom. 

## Main Technologies:
- React - Functional components, context, link, route and Hooks
- CRUD
- API calls
- CSS
- Bootstrap
-  Moment package for React

## Future Features:
- Adding events by users
- Sharing events on social media
- User page for liked events
- Comments on events
